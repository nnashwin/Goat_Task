1. Goat task is a task manager that centers around the majesty that are goats.

2. The name of my app is Goat task.

3.  Smiling goat for login page.
Text over the goat or aside the goat.

"Think less, do more, bleet the future."

4.  MVP for Goat_Task will be a login page, a task listing that provides users with the options to create tasks with deadlines and edit these tasks.  Upon completion of a task, the user will be presented with a congratulatory "Bleet" and gains a point in his/her "Bleet-counter".  Every week the "Bleet-counter" resets, but if the user can achieve a certain amount of bleets a week (on a tiered system), he/she will be presented with a picture of a goat/goat badge.  My Stretch goal is to be able to compare Bleet-counters in a "Bleetorium" online.

Features to think about.
Ranks on the Bleetorium - achievements
